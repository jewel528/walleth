# Contributing Guidelines

You are very welcome to submit PullRequests and Issues. Please keep the PullRequests small if not otherwise possible. Contact me *before* you are creating a big PR to avoid unnecessary work and rebasing of big PRs.

Please also add yourself to the contributors.json file and make sure "nick" matches your github name. Also please backup the private key for the ETH address you use there.

If you have a question please ask the [community](https://plus.google.com/communities/116353894782342292067).
