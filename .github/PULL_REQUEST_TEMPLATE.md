# PullRequest

Great that you are thinking about submitting a PullRequest!

Please keep them small if not otherwise possible. Contact me *before* you are creating a big PR to avoid unnecessary work and rebasing of big PRs. Also try to add tests - I am not dogmatic about that but prefer PRs backed by tests. This project has everything setup for Espresso UI and Unit-tests. Also the existing unit and UI-tests muss pass before submitting a PullRequest.

Please also add yourself to the contributors.json file and make sure "nick" matches your github name. Also please backup the private key for the ETH address you use there.

Please base the PullRequests on the branch named dev if one currently exists - otherwise use master
